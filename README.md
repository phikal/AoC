This repository contains my [Advent of Code][aoc] solutions-programms, 
for the year 2018. 

My goal is to finish all of them using [AWK][awk], specifically with the
[GAWK][gawk] (GNU AWK) interpreter. Most solutions are pretty cheep 
and inefficient... to say the very least.

All code is in the public domain. If there are any questions regarding 
my poorly commented and documented code, please [contact me][me]!
